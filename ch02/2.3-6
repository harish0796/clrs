Can we use binary search instead to improve the overall worst-case running time of insertion sort to O(nlogn)?

Although by using binary search, we have reduced the comparisions, we still have to shift all the elements after finding the element. This process still takes O(n) time so the running time is dominated by the shift operations. The runtime of insertion sort is still O(n^2).
