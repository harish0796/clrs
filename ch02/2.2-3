Consider linear search again. How many elements of the input sequence need to be checked on the average, assuming that the element being searched for is equally likely to be any element in the array? How about in the worst case? What are the average-case and worst-case running times of linear search in O-notation? Justify your answers.

Since the elements in the array are distributed in a uniform-fashion, 
P(X = x) = 1/n.
We can now calculate the average number of comparisions in linear search by finding the expected value
E[X] = 1/n + 2/n + 3/n + ... n/n = (n+1)/2
