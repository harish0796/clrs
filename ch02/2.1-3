LINEAR-SEARCH(A, v)
V=NIL
for i = 0 to A.length
  if A[i] == v
    V = i
return V

Proof:
Initialization: When i = 0 then the for loop turns to an IF statement which is trivial.

Maintenance: There is only one iteration of the loop.

Termination: When the loop finishes we either find the element or not, eitherway we return the answer.
