The travelling salesman problem is to find a path that contains a permutation of every node in the graph, while in the shortest path problem,
any given shortest path may or maynot contain a vertex and often times the shortest path is a proper subset of all the vertices.

Other differences include:
1) TSP requires its solution to be a cycle while a shortest path never contains cycles(non-negative edge weights).
2) TSP is an NP-complete problem where as shortest path is known polynomial-time.
